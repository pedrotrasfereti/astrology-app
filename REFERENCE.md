# Basic Concepts

## Astronomical Times

### Universal Time (UT1)

**Universal Time (UT1)** is a solar time standard that reflects the average speed of the Earth's rotation. It refers to the time it takes Earth to complete a full rotation in relation to the Sun.


### Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)** is the primary time standand globally used to regulate clocks and time.

It is synchronized and adjusted to stay within 0.9 seconds of UT1. Occasionally, a "leap second" is added to UTC in order keep it in sync with UT1 (which varies due to Earth's rotation).

### Sidereal Time

> **si·de·re·al**: (_adjective_) of or with respect to the distant stars (i.e. the constellations or fixed stars, not the sun or planets). 

**Sidereal time** reflects the period it takes Earth to complete a full rotation around it's axis in relation to a fixed object outside of Earth's orbit around the Sun.

Sidereal time is different at each longitude. This helps in calculating house cusps and the Ascendant (rising sign).

### Julian Day (JDN)

A **Julian day** is a continuous count of days that starts at noon on **January 1, 4713 BC**. This system is used by astronomers and in software to calculate the time between events.

For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at **12:00 UT (noon) on January 1, 2000**, was **2451545**.

> The Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in UTC. It is needed to calculate planetary positions.

## Calculation

### 1 - Latitude and Longitude

These are needed to calculate the Local Sidereal Time (LST), which adjusts the positions of the planets based on the local time zone and observer's location. LST is crucial for determining the Ascendant and House positions.

### 2 - Timezone Offset
Ensures the Universal Time (UT) is calculated correctly, as the positions of celestial bodies depend on the exact moment of birth in UTC.

# Sidereal vs. Tropical Astrology

**Tropical astrology** tends to be favored by Western astrologers, as it is deeply rooted in the seasons and the Earth's relationship to the Sun. Its focus on the equinoxes and solstices gives it a more symbolic or psychological interpretation of the zodiac signs, often reflecting an internal, personal journey aligned with the rhythm of the seasons. This system is thought to be more connected to human experience and life cycles, making it appealing for personal growth and forecasting based on the Sun's position.

**Sidereal astrology**, on the other hand, is favored by many in the Vedic (or Indian) tradition, as well as some Western astrologers who lean toward a more astronomical, star-based framework. The sidereal zodiac aligns more closely with the actual constellations, so it's seen by its supporters as more "astronomically accurate" because it doesn't ignore the precession of the equinoxes. This approach is often viewed as more objective or in touch with the universe's actual layout, as it stays consistent with the fixed stars in the sky.

> The main point of contention lies in the precession of the equinoxes, which causes a slow shift over time (about 1 degree every 72 years). Over thousands of years, this has created a gap between the two systems. For example, where the tropical Aries falls is currently about 24 degrees behind where sidereal Aries is located in the sky. This is why people with the same birthdate may have different sun signs depending on whether they use tropical or sidereal astrology.

Astrologers who use tropical astrology might argue that the *symbolic connection* to seasons is what's important, not the exact position of the stars. They may view sidereal astrology as too "astronomical" and detached from the personal and psychological meanings of the signs.

On the other hand, sidereal astrology practitioners might argue that their system is more faithful to the actual stars and more grounded in real astronomical observations, seeing tropical astrology as too disconnected from the actual positions in the sky.
